# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
Using unique pointers to create and delete objects under certain conditions. Ability to use mouse events to interact with the 
player character. Adding a score that keeps track of how many bullets hit the enemy if the player is alive.

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
Unique pointers are a new challenge, LaunchProjectiles() was the notable problem. Since most of the functions needed to be changed,
that was simple enough but putting LaunchProjectiles() into the vector of unique pointers was a problem because I needed to 
set there x and y. 

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
Implentation of Unique pointers.
